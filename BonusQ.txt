Q:User authentication: How would secure your API if you were requested to do so? 

A:I would use OAuth to expose a single endpoint for the login process.The client will then pass the user credentials to the API where the user is authenticated on the server.
Once authenticated, a security token is generated and stored on the server and is returned to the client.
The client will then pass this token to the API in order to access restricted endpoints. The token is validated on the server side.

Q: How much of your API / Code would be reused if you were to also develop an API that would be consumed from the mobile application?

A:Since its an exposed REST API the code could be reused in a mobile App.
The only change is the consumer of the API which should not make any difference at the back-end code.
